# Auto Template Trigger
This is a simple Obsidian plugin. (https://obsidian.md)  

It triggers the template prompt when creating a note.

## Prerequisites
It depends on the core `Templates` plugin to be enabled, and that a templates folder is being assigned.

## Usage
Make sure you have one or more template.  

If the built-in template plugin serves your needs well, this one might enhance your experience. 

## Behavior
### 1. Create a new note

### 2 The template prompt is automatically triggered

## Why it was made
I found myself manually triggering a template, whenewer I created a note, which was a bit cumbersome, especially on mobile. 
Now, a prompt is automatically triggered, which simplifies my workflow.

It probably won't work well with other plugins eg Templater or daily notes.
