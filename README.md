# Auto Template Prompt

This is a simple Obsidian plugin. (https://obsidian.md)  
It triggers the template prompt when creating a note. (And the Template plugin is enabled)

If the built-in template plugin serves your needs weel, this one might enhance your experience. 

I found myself manually triggering a template, whenewer I created a note, which was a bit cumbersome, especially on mobile. 
Now, a prompt is automatically triggered, which simplifies my workflow.

It probably won't work well with other plugins eg Templater or daily notes. 

## Behavior
### 1. Create a new note
